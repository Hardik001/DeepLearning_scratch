# DeepLearning_scratch
All the Projects in this repository are implemented using numpy,matplotlib and python without using deep-learning frameworks

### Optimization_algorithms  : contains various optimizations of Gradient Descent like Mini Batch Gradient Descent,GD with momentum,RMS prop,ADAM

### Football_problem: Recommend positions where France's goal keeper should kick the ball so that the French team's players can then hit it with their head.Also reduced overfitting using L2 regularization and Dropout Regularization
